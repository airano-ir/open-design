/**
 * The card list behind the 全部项目 grid.
 *
 * The invariant: **only SHARED projects appear here.** A project becomes shared
 * when the user takes the share action; until then it lives in 草稿 and nowhere
 * else. That is a product decision, recorded on the acceptance doc
 * (2026-07-20): "项目要用户点击共享动作才会共享，不然默认是会到草稿里". A previous
 * change read the grid's name literally and let every local project in — do not
 * redo that without checking with product first.
 *
 * So the list is: the member's own local projects that the hub already lists as
 * shared, plus the shared projects they have not pulled yet, deduped by id.
 *
 * A shared project the member has not pulled yet has no local record, so it is
 * synthesized into a normal card: placeholder name until the pull registers it
 * under its real name, timestamps from when it was shared.
 *
 * Names follow the hub catalog for rows owned by SOMEONE ELSE (a pulled copy's
 * local name freezes at pull time, so an owner's rename would otherwise never
 * converge here). The member's own rows keep the local name — their fresh
 * rename may not have round-tripped to the catalog yet, and letting the stale
 * catalog name win would look like the rename bounced.
